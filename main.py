Hello there young warrior. I have chosen you to complete a mission, a daring a difficult one,
but one I think you will succeed in, for all of our futures.

   Our village needs you to take back the Great Curry Recipe that has been rightfully ours, from The Great Evil King.
    I have a spy in the King's castle, who tells me that the recipe is stored in the dungeon.

    On the path you will follow there will be a hut, where a close friend of mine will take care of you for a night.
     Remember that on the path there are wild men and criminals. If you havent already take the wooden sword. Good luck, and be careful """,15)

Oh hello my friend! You must be the fine boy the village leader was talking about. I hope your journey so far has been safe.
If you haven't taken it already, take this bread and water, and a better sword. That wooden sword wont help you fight the king's men
Good luck on your journey boy!""",15)
